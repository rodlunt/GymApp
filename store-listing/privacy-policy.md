# Privacy Policy for Clean Reps

**Last updated: December 2024**

## I don't want your data

Seriously. I built this app for myself and decided to share it. I have no interest in collecting, storing, or selling your information. I don't have a server. I don't have a database of users. I don't even know you downloaded this app.

## What happens with your workout data

Everything you enter - exercises, sets, reps, weights, routines - stays on your phone. It's stored locally using your device's storage. It never gets sent anywhere. I couldn't access it even if I wanted to.

## What the app doesn't do

- Doesn't require an account
- Doesn't collect personal information
- Doesn't track your location
- Doesn't use analytics or tracking
- Doesn't phone home to any server
- Doesn't contain ads or ad tracking
- Doesn't share anything with anyone

## Third-party stuff

The app can look up exercises from the Wger fitness database (a free, public exercise API). When you search for exercises, that search query goes to their servers. No personal data is attached - it's just looking up exercise names and descriptions.

## Deleting your data

Your data is yours. It lives on your phone. To delete it:
- Clear the app's data in your phone's settings, or
- Just uninstall the app

That's it. There's nothing to delete on my end because I don't have anything.

## Why this policy exists

Google requires a privacy policy for Play Store apps. So here it is. The summary is: I'm not in the data business. I just wanted a simple workout app.
