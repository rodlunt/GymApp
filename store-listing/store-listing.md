## Full Description

I built this app because I was tired of fitness apps that want to be everything.

I don't need a social feed. I don't need AI meal plans. I don't need badges, streaks, or motivational quotes. I just need to remember what weight I lifted last week.

Clean Reps does one thing: it tracks your workouts. That's it.

**The basics:**

• Log your sets, reps, and weights
• Build routines that match how you train
• Check your history to see if you're progressing

**Multiple gym setups**

Got a home gym and a work gym? Travelling and stuck with hotel equipment? Set up different gym profiles with the equipment you have at each location. The app filters exercises based on what's actually available to you - no more scrolling past cable machines when all you've got is dumbbells.

**Track what matters**

• Personal records get flagged automatically - you'll know when you hit a PR
• Estimated 1RM charts show your strength gains over time
• Weekly volume stats so you can see if you're actually putting in work
• 4-week trend view to spot whether you're progressing or plateauing

**Smart scheduling**

The app remembers where you're at in your routine. Open the app, and it knows you're on Push Day or Leg Day or whatever's next. Missed a few days? It'll let you skip ahead.

**Works how you want**

• kg or lbs - your choice
• Dark mode for early mornings
• Works completely offline - no wifi at the gym? No problem

**What's NOT in the app:**

• No accounts or sign-ups
• No subscriptions or premium tiers
• No ads, ever
• No social features or sharing
• No "upgrade to unlock" nonsense
• No data collection

Everything works from day one. There's nothing to unlock, nothing to pay for, and nothing trying to keep you scrolling.

Your workout data stays on your phone. I don't have a server. I don't want your data. I built this for myself and figured others might want the same thing.

Open the app. Log your workout. Close the app. Get on with your day.
